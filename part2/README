*** PART 2 ***

I am using orig_argv as the full and complete parsed input by the user, it contains the tokens from the user in an array.
cur_argv is the current argument array, in the case of a piped command this will be the current command to execute

The way my command parsing is structured, if the user puts an '&' token in the middle of their input string, it will ignore everything after the '&' symbol

The one major issue I've found, and doesn't seem to be required by the assignment is that arguments in quotes aren't supported. For example, trying to 'git commit -m "some commit"' will seperate '"some' and 'commit"' into different tokens. This breaks functionality of these types of commands and I am aware of the problem

Debugging was done with ddd, and to test for memory leaks I used Valgrind
